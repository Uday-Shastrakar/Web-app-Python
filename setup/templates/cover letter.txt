Hi Team,

I am sending my profile for the java developer position. I have done graduation in BCA and training in Full Stack Java Developer with project-based hands-on work. I feel that working with Lentra will give me good exposure to the Artificial intelligence and Finance domain which is my area of interest. I aspire to grow my career in the same area. So it will be a great help if you can consider me for the open position.

Looking forward to your reply.
